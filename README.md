# Test-F2py

Using MiCGeneric Fortran code combined with f2py in numpy to test building and calling Fortran functions from python.

Get and install cython, numpy (and scipy for good measure)

```
pip install cython
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
```
For me, this results in f2py3.5 as an executable (and not f2py as in all documentation)
