## Details

**PART 1**

Straight compiling fortran and then importing to python and using subroutines.

_NOTE:_ Fortran functions get translated to all lower case.
```
f2py3.6 -c -m SomeMethods SomeMethods.f90
```

Then code in callfort.py for PART1. Note that we can send a parameter named totsim to the fortran code, modify the value and send the information back. It could get a little tricky as this gets more complicated. But that's the idea.


**PART 2**

Signature files.

Generating the signature file
```
f2py3.6 -h SomeMethods.pyf -m SomeMethods SomeMethods.f90
```

Compiling the code with the signature file
```
f2py3.6 -c SomeMethods.pyf SomeMethods.f90
```
Same code in callfort.py executes.

**PART 3**

Distribution. To come later.

**PART 4**

A more complicated compile.

_NOTE:_ We can specify compiler, and options. Here specifying multiple files and compilation order does matter!
```
f2py3.6 -c -m my_sim_model --fcompiler=gfortran --opt='-O3' my_declarations.f90 my_write.f90 my_sim_model.f90
```
